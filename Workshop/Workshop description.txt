[list][h2]This mod changes the game UI resolution to match the selected screen resolution[/h2][/list]
[/code]

The game UI resolution is always Full HD (1920x1080) regardless of the selected screen resolution, so the interface is too large on screens with a large diagonal.
Just subscribe and activate the mod and the interface will be scaled to match screen resolution.
Mod require Harmony

[b]WARNING![/b]
Some mod's UI elements cant be correct moved and scaled when resolution changed because they are not adapted for it and have fixed positions. So their buttons and panels may be in the wrong places or out of screen.
